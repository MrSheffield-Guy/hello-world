# hello-world
Just another repository
hello world! I am extremely new at programming so new in fact I have been spending most of my time just learning the jargon, conversely I have an enourmous thirst for knowledge and an eagerness to learn that is just as ferocious. I have been confused and lost in my journey and what excatly I wanted to do. I have wasted a ton of time learning about topics that had little to nothing to do with what I wanted my profession to be or what I wanted to do in the field of CS/IT but that is neither here nor there at this point. I took a step back, did some research, and made a clear and concise plan and now I am ready to grind it out. I know this will be challenging and at sometimes get frustrating but I welcome a challenge head on and face all adversity. I have faith that with consisteince and persistience I will get this!
